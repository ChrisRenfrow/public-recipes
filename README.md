# Recipes

A collection of personally selected recipes, defined using [Cooklang](https://cooklang.org/), the recipe markup language.

## Usage

- Download and install [CookCLI](https://cooklang.org/cli/download/)
- Clone this repo and enter the directory
- Run `cook server` and navigate to the url	(`http://127.0.0.1:9080` by default) listed

## Organization

Recipes are organized simply by type (salads, snacks, breakfasts, etc.) for now. I think I'll end up using the metadata tags for recipe attributes (vegan, gluten-free, etc.).
